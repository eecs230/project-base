# EECS 230 Project Base

This repository contains the same setup that we use for labs and homework assignments, including both `eecs230.h` and UnitTest++. You can copy it if you want a fresh CLion project to experiment with.

## How to use this

1.  Fork this repository on GitHub.
2.  Go into the settings for your new repository and change the repository’s name to something appropriate. (You won’t be able to fork a second time until you change the name.)
3.  Clone using CLion or your favorite Git client.
4.  Edit this README! :)

If that’s too complicated, you can skip GitHub and just download [a ZIP file of this repo](https://github.com/eecs230/project-base/archive/master.zip).
